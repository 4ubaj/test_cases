# Test cases

This is [sole](http://soledadpenades.com)'s collection of test cases.

Attaching a good test case with your bug report is a godssend for QA and developers. If you want to learn how to write test cases, feel free to have a look at this repo.

I'll try to comment them out and make them 'didactic', but you should ping me with any questions you might have. Create an issue so everyone else can benefit from an open discussion!

Thanks, and let's put everything to a test!
